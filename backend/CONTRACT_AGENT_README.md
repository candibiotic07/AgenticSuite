## 🔬 **Technical Deep Dive: Research Implementation**

### 🎯 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline**
```python
# For each clause analysis:
1. Semantic Retrieval: Search ChromaDB for 5 most similar clauses
2. Context Augmentation: Include similar clauses in LLM prompt
3. Enhanced Generation: LLM analyzes with historical context
4. Result Integration: Combine with rule-based findings
```

### 🔄 **CoVe Self-Consistency Implementation**
```python
# Self-verification through multiple iterations:
for iteration in range(3):
    prompt_variation = get_varied_prompt(iteration)
    analysis = llm.analyze(clause, prompt_variation)
    analyses.append(analysis)

# Majority voting and confidence aggregation
final_result = aggregate_with_voting(analyses)
```

### 🎓 **PRELUDE Preference Learning**
```python
# Continuous learning from user feedback:
user_corrections = load_feedback_history()
risk_tolerance = infer_patterns_by_clause_type(user_corrections)
correction_patterns = analyze_common_adjustments(user_corrections)
update_risk_registry(learned_patterns)
```

### 🧩 **Advanced Clause Processing**
- **Semantic Fingerprinting**: `md5(sorted_significant_words[:20])` for deduplication
- **Intelligent Segmentation**: Multi-pattern clause boundary detection
- **Confidence Calibration**: Self-reported confidence with uncertainty quantification
- **Priority Queue**: Uncertainty-weighted ranking for human review optimization

## 📖 Detailed Usage

### Contract Analysis Pipeline

```python
# 1. Initialize with custom settings
agent = ContractAgent(persist_directory='./my_contract_data')

# 2. Analyze contract with custom document ID
analysis = agent.analyze_contract(
    file_path='important_contract.pdf',
    document_id='project_alpha_agreement'
)

# 3. Review analysis results
print(f"Total clauses: {len(analysis.clauses)}")
print(f"Risk distribution: {analysis.executive_summary['risk_distribution']}")

# 4. Examine high-risk clauses
high_risk_clauses = [
    c for c in analysis.clauses 
    if c.risk_assessment and c.risk_assessment.risk_level == 'HIGH'
]

for clause in high_risk_clauses:
    print(f"Clause Type: {clause.metadata.clause_type}")
    print(f"Risk Rationale: {clause.risk_assessment.rationale}")
    print(f"Suggestions: {clause.risk_assessment.suggestions}")
```

### Feedback Collection & Learning

```python
# Get clauses prioritized for review
priority_clauses = agent.get_prioritized_review_list(analysis)

# Provide feedback on the top priority clause
top_clause = priority_clauses[0]
feedback = {
    'risk_level': 'MEDIUM',  # Your corrected assessment
    'reason': 'This clause is standard in our industry',
    'confidence': 0.9,
    'notes': 'Common payment terms, not unusual risk'
}

# Collect feedback (automatically updates learning)
agent.collect_user_feedback(top_clause, feedback)

# Update system preferences based on feedback history
preferences = agent.update_preferences()
print(f"Learned preferences: {preferences}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Custom initialization with advanced settings
agent = ContractAgent(persist_directory='./enterprise_contracts')

# Access individual components for fine-tuning
risk_analyzer = agent.risk_analyzer
vector_store = agent.vector_store
feedback_manager = agent.feedback_manager

# Search for similar clauses manually
similar = vector_store.search_similar_clauses(
    query_text="payment terms",
    clause_type="payment",
    n_results=10
)
```

## 📊 Understanding Risk Assessment

### Risk Levels
- **HIGH**: Immediate attention required, significant legal/financial risk
- **MEDIUM**: Should be reviewed, moderate risk or unusual terms
- **LOW**: Standard language, minimal risk

### Priority Scoring
The system calculates priority scores to help you focus on the most important clauses:

```
Priority Score = Risk Level Weight × (1 - Confidence Score)

Where:
- Risk Level Weight: HIGH=3, MEDIUM=2, LOW=1
- Confidence Score: 0.0-1.0 (LLM's confidence in assessment)
```

High priority scores indicate clauses that are both risky and uncertain, requiring human review.

### Clause Types Detected
1. **Payment & Financial** - Terms, fees, penalties
2. **Liability & Indemnification** - Risk allocation, damages
3. **Termination & Breach** - Exit conditions, defaults
4. **Intellectual Property** - Rights, ownership, licenses
5. **Confidentiality & NDA** - Information protection
6. **Force Majeure** - Uncontrollable events
7. **Governing Law** - Jurisdiction, dispute resolution
8. **Warranties** - Guarantees, representations

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. API Key Not Set**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_key'
# or create .env file with: GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
```

**2. ChromaDB Issues**
```bash
# Clear vector database if corrupted
rm -rf ./contract_agent_data/vectorstore
```

**3. PDF Processing Fails**
```bash
# Install additional dependencies for OCR
pip install pytesseract
# Install tesseract system package (varies by OS)
```

**4. PDF Report Generation Fails**
```bash
# WeasyPrint dependencies (Linux)
sudo apt-get install python3-cffi python3-brotli libpango-1.0-0 libharfbuzz0b libpangoft2-1.0-0

# Alternative: Use HTML reports only
html_report = agent.generate_report(analysis, 'html')
```

### Performance Optimization

**Large Documents**
- Process in chunks for very large contracts (>100 pages)
- Use document_id to avoid reprocessing same files
- Clear old vector data periodically

**API Cost Management**
- Monitor Gemini API usage in Google Cloud Console
- Use confidence thresholds to reduce LLM calls on obvious cases
- Implement caching for similar clauses

## 🔮 Advanced Use Cases

### Enterprise Integration

```python
# Batch processing multiple contracts
contracts = ['contract1.pdf', 'contract2.pdf', 'contract3.pdf']
analyses = []

for contract_path in contracts:
    analysis = agent.analyze_contract(contract_path)
    analyses.append(analysis)
    
# Comparative analysis across contracts
# (Custom implementation based on specific needs)
```

### Custom Risk Patterns

```python
# Add custom rules to risk registry
import json

with open('risk_registry.json', 'r') as f:
    registry = json.load(f)

# Add new payment risk pattern
registry['payment']['high_risk'].append('immediate payment required')

with open('risk_registry.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(registry, f, indent=2)
```

### Industry-Specific Customization

```python
# Create industry-specific agent instances
tech_agent = ContractAgent(persist_directory='./tech_contracts')
legal_agent = ContractAgent(persist_directory='./legal_contracts')

# Each maintains separate learning and preferences
```
